    <div class="earthHistory">
      <p>Earth formed around 4.6 billion years ago through the accretion of cosmic dust and debris. Over time, the planet underwent several major geological and biological transformations. These include the formation of the first continents, the emergence of primitive life forms in the oceans, the development of photosynthesis and the subsequent rise in atmospheric oxygen levels, the emergence of complex organisms, and the evolution of humans. The history of Earth is characterized by cycles of gradual change punctuated by catastrophic events such as mass extinctions and volcanic eruptions.
        The history of the Earth can be divided into four major eons: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. During the Hadean eon, the planet was largely molten and underwent heavy bombardment from space debris. The Archean eon saw the emergence of the first life forms and the development of continents. The Proterozoic eon was marked by the emergence of complex organisms and the rise of oxygen levels. The Phanerozoic eon is the most recent and is characterized by the diversification of life and the emergence of land animals, including humans. Throughout its history, the Earth has undergone numerous geological and biological changes, shaping the planet we know today.</p>

      <h2 class="astroidTitle">Asteroids that flew by Earth</h2>
      <p>Asteroids can fly by Earth in a number of ways, depending on their speed, trajectory, and distance. Some asteroids come very close to Earth and may even pass within the Moon's orbit. These are known as near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and they are of particular interest to scientists because of their potential to collide with Earth.

        The vast majority of NEAs are small and pose no threat to Earth. However, larger asteroids can potentially cause significant damage if they were to collide with our planet. Scientists closely monitor the orbits of NEAs and use telescopes and other instruments to track their movements and predict their future paths.
        
        When an asteroid flies by Earth, it typically follows a curved path around our planet due to the gravitational pull of Earth. This path can be influenced by other factors, such as the gravity of the Moon or other planets, as well as the asteroid's own momentum and velocity.
        
        Asteroids can fly by Earth at various speeds, ranging from a few kilometers per second to tens of kilometers per second. The faster an asteroid is moving, the more difficult it is to detect and track. Some asteroids also have irregular shapes and rotations, which can make them more difficult to study.
        
        Overall, the study of asteroids and their flybys of Earth is an important area of research that can help us better understand the nature of our solar system and the potential threats that asteroids may pose to our planet.
